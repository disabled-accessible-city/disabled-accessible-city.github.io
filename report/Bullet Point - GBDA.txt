For Introduction
- Whether the accessibility of the train travels and the distribution of the disabled population are relatively matched
- Status of population density and proportion
- Distribution and proportion of accessible rail stations
- Compare between accessibility and disability (gap exsists)
- Explore in a specific city or region (London; Liverpool & Knowsley; * If there are sufficient words remaining, may discuss Manchester for linking to the Bogdan Part)

For Conclusion
- There is a regional difference in accessibility of the train station, accessible proportion is just a way of presenting data, and 100% accessible proportion does not mean that there are more accessible stations in this local authority area.
- At the local authority level, the distribution of the disabled population is very different between the proportion and the density.
- In terms of data, accessibility logically corresponds to the level of disability
- Rail station's accessible facilities of Great Britain still need a lot of improvements, and some plans are already under implementation
